This is a simple Rails application created by a high school student at JDHS for the media teacher.
It's a simple video collection with user rights to create new or modify old videos.
jdmedia is also used as a teaching device so others at the high school can learn about Rails.

*All videos are actually stored on a separate site* (presumably vimeo.com).
The only thing that is needed for a video is its embed code.
